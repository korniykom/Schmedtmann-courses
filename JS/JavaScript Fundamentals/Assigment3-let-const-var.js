// Note: avoid using var

// 1. Set the value of language to the language spoken where you
// live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one).

// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables
// (which values will never change, and which might change?).
// Then, change these variables to const.

// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now,
//  and observe what happens.
